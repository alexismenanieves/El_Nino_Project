## Readme

This repository has three files:

1. Data.csv, which is a csv file that contains the dataset
2. Precipitation.tif, which is the raster file for precipitation
2. El_Nino_Analysis.ipynb, which reads the files, analizes the series, and plot the precipitation maps to find the maximum correlation
3. El_Nino_LSTM_Regression.ipynb, which creates a model to predict the Southern Oscillation Index

This repository gets the datasets from [ESRI] (https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api/blob/master/samples/04_gis_analysts_data_scientists/data/).
